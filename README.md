# Smart_Queuing_System

## Main Tasks
The following are the steps of the project. At a high level, I have:

1. Proposed a possible hardware solution
2. Built an application and tested its performance on the DevCloud using multiple hardware types
3. Compared the performance to see which hardware performed best
4. Revised my proposal based on the test results

## The Scenarios
The following three different scenarios depict real-world problems based on different sectors where edge devices are typically deployed.

**Scenario 1: Manufacturing Sector**

**Scenario 2: Retail Sector**

**Scenario 3: Transportation Sector**

All of the scenarios involve people in queues, but each scenario requires different hardware. So the first task was to determine which hardware might work for each scenarioâ€”and then explain the initial choice in a proposal document.
Finally, after building and testing the application on each hardware device for all three scenarios, I reviewed the results and updated my initial proposed choices in the proposal document.
